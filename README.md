<h2>Retrieve after hours failed login attempts:</h2>

<p align="center">
There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours.

The first part of the screenshot is my query, and the second part is a portion of the output. This query filters for failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. First, I started by selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table. Then, I used a WHERE clause with an AND operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred after 18:00 and were unsuccessful. The first condition is login_time > '18:00', which filters for the login attempts that occurred after 18:00. The second condition is success = FALSE, which filters for the failed login attempts. <br />

Retrieve login attempts on specific dates: <br/>
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before needs to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates.
